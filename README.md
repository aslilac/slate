# Slate

Hayleigh said she'd learn Rust if I learned Elm, so here I am, learning Elm!

Basically a Wordle clone, because that's the hot thing of last week and it seemed like an
easy-enough-but-not-quite-trivial thing that would be doable for both of us, in both
languages.

### Name?

I actually have a reason this time. It's because 3Blue1Brown made a
[fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) about the statistics behind
Wordle, and how an algorithm would play it "optimally". He shortly after made
[another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg) correcting some mistakes from
the first one. In it, he shows that one of the most optimal opening guesses is "slate".
It's not _the_ most optimal, but it strikes the right balance of "optimal" and
"recognizable".
