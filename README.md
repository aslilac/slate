# Slate

![A screenshot of the game being played, where the first guess is "tries", the second guess is "plant", and the final correct guess is "slate"](https://cdn.mckayla.cloud/-/8b065c3491ad49cba9f5f3b49cf1877f/slate.webp)

Hayleigh said she'd learn Rust if I learned Elm, so here I am, learning Elm!

Basically a Wordle clone, because that's the hot thing of last week and it seemed like an
easy-enough-but-not-quite-trivial thing that would be doable for both of us, in both
languages.

### How to play

Well, if you want an actual rules summary, plenty of other people have already described
them better than I think I could.

If you want a cheat sheet, I have a pretty good one.

-   Guess "SLATE"
-   Guess "HOUND"
-   See if you can deduce the answer from the information these two give you (surprisingly
    often, this is enough)
-   If you still need more hints, guess "PRICK", and that gives you hints on over half of
    the alphabet, including all of the vowels (except Y, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I think you can figure
    it out from here.

### Name?

I actually have a reason this time. It's because 3Blue1Brown made a
[fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) about the statistics behind
Wordle, and how an algorithm would play it "optimally". He shortly after made
[another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg) correcting some mistakes from
the first one. In it, he shows that one of the most optimal opening guesses is "slate".
It's not _the_ most optimal, but it strikes the right balance of "optimal" and
"recognizable".
