# Slate

![A screenshot of the game being played, where the first guess is "tries", the second guess is "plant", and the final correct guess is "slate"](https://cdn.mckayla.cloud/-/8b065c3491ad49cba9f5f3b49cf1877f/slate.webp)

## How to play

Your goal is to guess a 5 letter English word with 6 guesses or less. All of your guesses must be English words. Letters that your guess shares with the answer will be green if they're also in the same position, or yellow if the letter appears somewhere else. No color means that the letter is not in the answer.

If you want a cheat sheet, I have a pretty good one:

1. Guess "SLATE"
1. Guess "HOUND"
1. See if you can deduce the answer from the information these two give you (surprisingly often, this is enough)
1. If you still need more hints, guess "PRICK", and that gives you hints on over half of the alphabet, including all of the vowels (except Y, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I think you can figure it out from here.

## Name?

I actually have a reason this time. It's because 3Blue1Brown made a [fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) about the statistics behind Wordle, and how an algorithm would play it "optimally". He shortly after made [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg) correcting some mistakes from the first one. In it, he shows that one of the most optimal opening guesses is "slate". It's not _the_ most optimal, but it strikes the right balance of "optimal" and "recognizable". s
